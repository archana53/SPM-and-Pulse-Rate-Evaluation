Download the raw data and Algorithms.ipynb from the repository.

Link to Raw Data : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LlsIKCNKl7lclab5NGq7FuQPwcaMvonK/view?usp=sharing

Extract each video of the raw data into the same folder as the Algorithms.ipynb. 
The outputs are already present in the file. 
Incase, we have to re-run, the required libraries are :
  Open CV library 
  Numpy
  Matlabplot
  Scipy
  Moviepy
  
Run through all the cells for the necessary plots corresponding to peak analysis and DFT.
